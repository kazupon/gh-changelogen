### Options

- `--repo`: GitHub repository name, format `owner/repo` (e.g. `kazupon/gh-changelogen`)
- `--tag`: GitHub release tag (e.g. `v0.0.1`)
- `--token`: GitHub token, if you won’t specify, respect `GITHUB_TOKEN` env
- `--output`: Changelog file name to create or update. defaults to `CHANGELOG.md` and resolved relative

## 💪 Motivation

- GitHub Rleases is awesome, it automatically generates the changelog.
- However, not all people will see the changelog in the Github Releases UI.
- Some people prefer the text base of changelog.
- Github Releases cannot sync changelog of repo.
- So I need tool to generate Github Releases as the **single-of-truth** for changelog.
