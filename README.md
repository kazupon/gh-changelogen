## 💁 About GitHub Token

If you won’t specify `-token`, `gh-changelogen` respect `GITHUB_TOKEN` env.

## 💪 Motivation

- GitHub Rleases is awesome, it automatically generates the changelog.
- However, not all people will see the changelog in the Github Releases UI.
- Some people prefer the text base of changelog.
- Github Releases cannot sync changelog of repo.
- So I need tool to generate Github Releases as the **single-of-truth** for changelog.
